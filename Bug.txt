#BUG

Steps to reproduce:
 1. Open the Navigator site
 2. Click on the button "Kreiraj objekat"
 3. Enter the field "Naziv" on your own
 4. Enter the city field "Beograd"
 5. Enter the post number "74000"
 6. Click on the "Odaberi kategoriju" button
 7. Choose "Kafa"
 8. Click button "Kreiraj"

The app gives the message: "Došlo je do neočekivane greške. Molimo pokušajte ponovo!" and the user must exit the form and reenter.
The correct behaviour would be to inform the user about the bad data and help him/her correct it.
